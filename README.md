## Description :classical_building:

I recently completed a frontend project for a potential tattoo and piercing shop. The primary goal was to connect the frontend with a database that had already been developed (accessible through a link I can provide). My work involved ensuring the frontend could effectively display the services offered, manage new user registrations, allow registered users to access and modify their profiles, handle appointment requests for services, and provide options for viewing and deleting appointments. As the developer, I also implemented functionality where the super admin can oversee the entire user list and delete user accounts as necessary.
